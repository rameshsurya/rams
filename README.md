This project is to build a model to predict LC50 value of chemicals 
This dataset was used to develop quantitative regression QSAR models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) on a set of 908 chemicals. LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in 50% of test fish over a test duration of 96 hours, was used as model response. The model comprised 6 molecular descriptors: MLOGP (molecular properties), CIC0 (information indices), GATS1i (2D autocorrelations), NdssC (atom-type counts), NdsCH ((atom-type counts), SM1_Dz(Z) (2D matrix-based descriptors).
on evaluating many models SVR model is the best fit model to predict LC50 value
